Removed Reasoner documentation
=============================

Purpose: Internal deterministic reasoning engine scaffold for the project. It contains:

- `src/stratamind/core`: core deterministic reasoner runtime.
- `src/stratamind/analysis`: static scanning helpers.
- `src/stratamind/generation`: deterministic suggestions.
- `src/stratamind/prompting`: safe prompt templates. (neutralized)

Guidelines:

- Do not add secrets or API keys here; client-side safe flags only.
- The Reasoner must be deterministic for local development and testing purposes.
- Keep all changes accompanied by unit tests under `src/stratamind`.

Security & Compliance:

- Avoid exposing model internals; the core is intentionally deterministic and simple.
- Audit logs and traces should be generated by the core and logged via the central `logs` system.

Install Node.js and npm (Windows)
---------------------------------

The project requires Node.js (LTS >= 18) and npm >= 9. Choose one installation method below.

- Using winget (recommended for latest LTS):

```powershell
winget install --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS -e
```

-- Using nvm-windows (recommended for version management):

1. Install nvm-windows from: [nvm-windows releases](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)

2. Open PowerShell, then install and use a Node version:

```powershell
nvm install 18.20.0
nvm use 18.20.0
node -v
npm -v
npm install -g npm@latest
```

-- Using the official Node.js installer:

1. Download the LTS (recommended) MSI from: [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

2. Run the installer and accept defaults

3. Open a new shell, then verify `node -v` and `npm -v`

Post-install verification and repo setup
--------------------------------------

After installing Node.js and npm, run these commands in the project root:

```powershell
npm ci
npm run check:env
Removed: Stratamind Reasoner docs. The Reasoner UI and backend have been removed from this repository.

This file previously documented the internal Reasoner. It has been intentionally removed to eliminate StrataMind surfaces.
